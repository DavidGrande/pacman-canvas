During my formation in the Higher Education Intitution, i did this pacman in Javascript and Canvas.

Everything started as a challenge and over time it took shape.

Now i was started to upload the code here and fixing my errors.

To do list:
- Ghosts have to go out one by one from here cell.
- Ghosts and Pacman could have a status.
  - The ghost have to change the color and heres movement, they must run away.
  - Pacman have to change the color too when he eat a Big dot
  - Sounds generals for ghosts and Sounds expecified for Pacman. Maybe too of the game.
- Add fruits
